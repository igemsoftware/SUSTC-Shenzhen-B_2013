BioMiao
=======
This is the project of igem 2013 by SUSTC-Shenzhen-B_2013.
----------------------------------------------------------
### Overview

Our project, BioMiao,is written in javascript,php,java and C#, for we have the ambition to create a community for the whole synthetic biology. This community is based on our original idea, Mind Road. The key point of this community is sharing ideas; it is also the theme of Mind Road. Mind Road is a net structural mind map that can help users review, think and share ideas. We also make a Circuit List to record all the projects that are in Mind Road. Now it is on Clotho, too. Besides Mind Road, we also offer other auxiliary tools such as LGD and TTEC. LGD is a genetic circuit designer which can help edit genetic circuit and present the result. TTEC is a tool to calculate the efficiency of rho-independent transcription terminators, made by SUSTC-Shenzhen-B 2012. This year we put it in BioMiao to facilitate users in editing their own genetic circuits. What is more, we also put it on Clotho to make it more convenient.

Software Running
If you just want to use our software, we recommend you to vist our website:[http://www.sustc-genome.org.cn/igem2013/mindroad.php](http://www.sustc-genome.org.cn/igem2013/mindroad.php)(Strongly suggest)

If you want to run the software locally and edit it,please download  all files in the registry first , then you need to start your Mysql and Apache,
