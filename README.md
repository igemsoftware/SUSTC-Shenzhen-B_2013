BioMiao
=======
This is the project of igem 2013 by SUSTC-Shenzhen-B_2013.

### Overview

Our project, BioMiao,is written in javascript,php,java and C#, for we have the ambition to create a community for the whole synthetic biology. This community is based on our original idea, Mind Road. The key point of this community is sharing ideas; it is also the theme of Mind Road. Mind Road is a net structural mind map that can help users review, think and share ideas. We also make a Circuit List to record all the projects that are in Mind Road. Now it is on Clotho, too. Besides Mind Road, we also offer other auxiliary tools such as LGD and TTEC. LGD is a genetic circuit designer which can help edit genetic circuit and present the result. TTEC is a tool to calculate the efficiency of rho-independent transcription terminators, made by SUSTC-Shenzhen-B 2012. This year we put it in BioMiao to facilitate users in editing their own genetic circuits. What is more, we also put it on Clotho to make it more convenient.

### Software Requirment
Apache
php5
html5
git
Mysql
Chrome, Firefox,IE10, safary is recommand

### Directory structure
		-Clotho      #Clotho app TTEC
		-js          #Library code
		--Code       #Core updating of TTEC
		-comments    #Server side for comments
		-css         #Style
		-css1        
		-img         #Pictures used

### Software Running
If you just want to use our software, we recommend you to vist our website:[http://www.sustc-genome.org.cn/igem2013/mindroad.php](http://www.sustc-genome.org.cn/igem2013/mindroad.php)(Strongly suggest)<br/>

If you want to run the software locally and edit it,please download  all files in the registry first , then you need to start your Mysql and Apache,
then please import "db_bacteria2.sql" to your database,after that ,you need to edit interface of servers,change it to your servers.If you finish all steps above,run "index.html"

Medals Requirement
==================
### Bronze Medal
1.Register the team, have a great summer, and have fun attending the Jamboree.<br/>
2.Create and share a description of the team's project via the iGEM wiki.<br/>
[Our wiki](http://2013.igem.org/Team:SUSTC-Shenzhen-B）<br/>
3.Present a Poster and Talk at the iGEM Jamboree.<br/>
4.Develop and make available via the The Registry of Software Tools an open source software tool that supports synthetic biology based on BioBrick standard biological parts.<br/>
[Our software]（https://github.com/igemsoftware/SUSTC-Shenzhen-B_2013）



### Silver Medal

1A.Provide a detailed, draft specification for the next version of your software tool<br/>
		see [feature]() for more information<br/>
1B.Provide a second, distinct (yet complementary) software tools project.<br/>
		-Clotho is the second distinct software tools see[clotho]() for more information<br/>
2.Provide a demonstration of their software either as a textual or video tutorial made available on their wiki. This tutorial should explain all the features of the tool as well as provide sample input and output as appropriate.
		see [tutorial](）for more





Gold Medal


1. Have another team utilize the software developed by your team. You must clearly show how your software was used and the results that were obtained. 

2a. Outline and detail how your software effects Human Practices in Synthetic Biology. Such topics include: safety, security, ethics, or ownership, sharing, and innovation.
OR
2b. In place of requirement two, a team may instead use SBOL in your software documentation.
（2选一）


3a. Develop and document a new technical standard that supports one of the following:
design of BioBrick Parts or Devices
construction of BioBrick Parts or Devices
characterization of BioBrick Parts or Devices
the analysis, modeling, and simulation of BioBrick Parts or Devices
the sharing of BioBrick Parts or Devices, either via physical DNA or as information via the internet.
OR
3b. Build upon existing software from a previous iGEM competition found on the The Registry of Software Tools
